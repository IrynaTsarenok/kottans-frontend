# My impressions of studying the material:
 The first request will be in the form of a course. It was necessary to independently review the theoretical material in the form of video and text material. The videos were short and very clear. This part was the easiest for me, because I was already theoretically familiar with this material. The second part was in the form of a simulator, which helped to practically master this knowledge. It was more difficult, the tasks became more difficult with each successive one, but it helped a lot to understand how everything works in practice.
 GIT knowledge will be 100% essential in real work environment in my opinion.
